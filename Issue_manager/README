This program is a prototype of a programe for corporate companies for resolving issues.

Basic user creates an issue with a form on front page, filling in all windows of the form and submitting it.

The issue will then be placed into databasis. Available only to admin staff. These admins have to me manually put into another database related to the one of the issues.
Admins has to have a username and a password.

When the admin logs in the issues are sorted out in a table by date of the latest till the newest submitted.

Admin can then click on the button assigned to the issue and solve it by choosing "solved" in drop bar options(in progress, solved).
