# Issue-Manager
Simple Web app for corporate use :)


You should be able to add new issues into database using main site (index.php) form. Then if you are and admin you can log in and see a table with unresolved issues at this moment, you hloud be able to change theyre status and after you set the status to "finished" it will remove itself from the table.
